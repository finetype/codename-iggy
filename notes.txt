some code comments:
==========================
app.get /users
--is this how people are really supposed to log in?

app.get /decks
--should be calling GetCards

app.post /decks
--we should be writing cards, reading decks.**to be discussed


to discuss:
==========================
-database structure/options 
--local storage of decks (should be deemed high priority)
--syncing decks

-basic data movement pattern, frequency of syncs...
--we should only ever be retrieving decks
---retrieve all on login, confirm sync'd before read/write?
--we should POST a create deck that is empty when we make a new deck
--otherwise, we should only ever be writing individual cards.


project path:
==========================
-recreate anki from scratch
-refactor branch to sync with anki
