some code comments:
==========================

many others with decks: 
--consistency between URL's for decks and card ID's?

server utils:
--we need a function here to return only a single deck
--getCards should be getDecks, and should return an array of decks


to discuss:
==========================
-database structure/options 
--local storage of decks (should be deemed high priority)
--syncing decks

-basic data movement pattern, frequency of syncs...
--we should only ever be retrieving decks
---retrieve all on login, confirm sync'd before read/write?
--we should POST a create deck that is empty when we make a new deck
--otherwise, we should only ever be writing individual cards.


project path:
==========================
-recreate anki from scratch
-refactor branch to sync with anki
